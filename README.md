# Demand Forecasting with Exponential Smoothing

This repository contains the process and results of demand forecasting for BC Premium Seafood for the year 2022/2023 using exponential smoothing and Excel Solver.

## Overview

The forecasting process involved analyzing demand patterns for BC Premium Seafood products, focusing on identifying seasonality and overall trends in demand throughout the year. The study indicated distinctive seasonal fluctuations, particularly observing trends in the following months:

- October: Downward trend in demand
- January: Upward trend in demand
- February: Downward trend in demand
- March: Upward trend in demand
- April: Upward trend in demand
- May: Downward trend in demand
- July: Upward trend in demand

The most notable seasonality appeared in January, showing the most significant upward trend in demand.

## Exponential Smoothing

The analysis included applying exponential smoothing to the demand data, which revealed an overall upward trend with minimal fluctuations.

## Forecasting for 2022/2023

After implementing exponential smoothing and using forecasting tools in Excel, the monthly demand forecast for the year 2022/2023 was generated. The forecast indicates a considerable drop in demand for October and a substantial surge in demand for January. The utilization of Excel Solver helped determine the optimal values for Alpha and Beta to minimize average forecast errors.

## Recommendations

It is recommended that BC Premium Seafood carefully considers the forecasted demand for 2022/2023 to address stockout issues. The forecast provides insights to adjust production according to the anticipated demand, assisting in minimizing excess inventory and optimizing supply chain costs. By leveraging this forecasting data, BC Premium Seafood can align their production with expected demand, reducing the risk of overproduction or shortages.
